# Script to perform a pull request merge correctly updating the library submodule hashes.
# 
# Usage:
# Make sure your local repository is the same of the pull request (ojs, omp or ocs).
# Also, there is no library only pull requests. All library changes must have a app
# submodule commit, so run this script always in app folder.
#
# Also make sure that your local branch is the one the pull request will be merged into, 
# both for application and library. Make sure that both are updated and clean from other 
# local commits or files. This script will not check this.
#
# After that, just run the command passing the correct parameters.
# 
# ./lib/pkp/mergePullRequest.sh github_user feature_branch application_only bug_id
#
# github_user: 
#   The user where the pull request comes from. This script assumes users will
#   for the official repositories so they will have forks on their own github account where the
#   changed code will be.
#
# feature_branch:
#   The branch inside the user forked repository where the pull request code is.
#
# application_only:
#   The pull request changes only application code? Or it does change pkp library code also?
#   Use 0 to false and 1 to true.  
#
# bug_id:
#   The bug entry id related to this pull request (optional).


# Asks for confirmation and return user input as true of false.
