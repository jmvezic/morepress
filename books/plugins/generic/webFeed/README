About
-----
This plugin for OMP provides a set of syndication feeds for the current issue in RSS1.0/RDF and Atom formats.  Feed links
are embedded into the HTML page header and are available to all RSS/Atom-aware browsers and aggregators as per standard web
specifications.

Known Issues
------------
- Improperly-formatted (non-RFC2822) email addresses within monographs or contact addresses may cause invalid feeds to be
generated.
- Monographs with no abstract (eg. editorials) will create Atom warnings due to lack of entry:content or entry:summary
elements.
- Multiple monographs with the same publish date/time (eg. in an issue) may create an Atom warning.

Contact/Support
