		<h3>General Privacy Information</h3>

		<h3>Usage Statistics</h3>
		<p>In order to be able to analyse usage and impact of our publications, we collect and log access to the homepage, categories, series, books and files. In the process all data is anonymised. No personal information is logged. IP addresses are anonymised by being hashed (using <em>SHA 256</em>) in combination with a <em>secure 64 characters long salt</em> that is automatically <em>randomly generated and overridden on a daily basis</em>. Therefore IP addresses cannot be reconstructed.</p>
		<p>The following information is collected next to the anonymised IP addresses:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Access type (i.e. administrative)</li>
		<li>Request time</li>
		<li>Requested URL</li>
		<li>HTTP status code</li>
		<li>Browser</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The collected data is only used for evaluation purposes. No IP addresses are mapped to user IDs. It is technically impossible to trace a specific set of data to a specific IP address.</p>]]></message>
