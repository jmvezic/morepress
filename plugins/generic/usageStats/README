Data Privacy Option
--------------------

REQUIREMENTS:
In order to use the data privacy option, insert the section "[usageStats]" in the
config.inc.php file and define the variable "salt_filepath" there, e.g. like this:

[usageStats]
salt_filepath = /path/to/your/salt_file

The file must exist, must be readable and writable for the web user and
must NOT be backed up (in order to ensure the privacy protection)!!!

This option will hash the logged IP addresses using a randomly generated salt that will be daily changed.
The salt is randomly generated either using:
- the function mcrypt_create_iv, which requires the PHP mcrypt
- the function openssl_random_pseudo_bytes, which requires the PHP openssl
- the file /dev/urandom, which works only on *nix systems
- the function mt_rand, which is not cryptographically safe.
Thus, if you are using a Windows server, please ensure that you install either the PHP mcrypt or openssl,
in order to have the cryptographically safe generated salt.
